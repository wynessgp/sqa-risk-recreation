# Instructor Meeting Week 3

Attendees: Yiji, 

### Instructor pre-meeting inspection
1. The project board indicates good planning effort and is a good progress indicator.
2. From the Project board, PRs, active branches, and the commit history, it is not clear to me whether all the team members have been contributing equally. A question to ask during the meeting.
   
### discussed teamwork challenges
Challenges:

   
### Went over grading rubrics
Emphasize that the game needs to be playable with one win condition.

### Questions from the team
N/A

### Recommendations and Other Notes
1. Picked a GUI library that the team feels the most comfortable with.
2. No BVA, TDD, and test cases are needed for the GUI code.
3. No BVA, TDD, and test cases are needed for setters and getters unless they do more than setting and gettering the instance variable.
4. Implement the GUI part alongside the backend development.
5. For the tasks in the Project board, instead of defining one as "Test X Class", try defining each one as a small computation/functionality. For instance, one task could be "Throw one die", and briefly document 1) what class is under development, 2) what external classes are needed, 3) what public methods are under development, and 4) what interfaces are needed to interact with the external classes.
