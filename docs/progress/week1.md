# Intructor feedback
## Progress evaluation :scroll:
Good progress for Week 1!

## Suggested next action items :fist:
1)  Don't forget to add the GitHub Action (the gradle.yml) and the badge to README
2)  thoroughly understanding the game rules, and
3)  starting to work on the requirement docs (which I can tell from your Project board that you are already planning on it!)

## Highlight of your team's work :partying_face:
The setup is done very fast! Good job!

## Improvements to consider :star:
None :).
