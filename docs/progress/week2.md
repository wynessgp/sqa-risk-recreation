# Intructor feedback
## Progress evaluation :scroll:
Good evidence of making progress! But be sure every team member is contributing.

## Suggested next action items :fist:
1. Split the tasks for Game Setup Phase.
2. Document the tasks in the GitHub Projects board.
3. Start the development for the Game Setup Phase.(Make sure to ALWAYS do BVA first (document them in docs/bva). Then follow TDD.)

## Highlight of your team's work :partying_face:
It seems that everyone is actively participating in the project. Good job!

## Improvements to consider :star:
1. Please format the progress report markdown (md) file properly. For instance, "### PR done and approved" should have 4 "#". 
2. Make sure to do enough project planning and document the task deligation in the GitHub Projects board.
